# gphoto2-go

Go bindings for [libgphoto2](https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2), allowing you to control cameras directly from Go programs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While it does work (kind of), this package is extremely unstable and nowhere near complete. Use it at your own risk!

## installation

```console
$ go get github.com/weebney/gphoto2-go
```

## todo:
```
days:
- add documentation
- add tests
- rewrite everything?

weeks:
- move to some type of automatic binding generator (?)
```

## dedications
- This project was forked from [aqiank/go-gphoto2](https://github.com/aqiank/go-gphoto2), which had not been updated since 2014â€”the code is derived from his work, though, so a big shout-out goes to him.
- [Marcus Meissner](https://github.com/msmeissn),  [Hans Niedermann](https://github.com/ndim), and the other contributors to [libgphoto2](https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2) and [libgphoto2](https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2).
- [You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)), the reader! Thank you for using, supporting, and contributing to this project.
